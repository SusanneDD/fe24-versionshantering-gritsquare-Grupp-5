## 💡 About the Project

**Public MessageBoard** was created to offer a free and open space for anyone to express thoughts, ideas, or simply leave a kind message. There are no accounts, no signups – just you and your words.

From the start, the vision was clear: Build a public wall where anyone can say something that matters. The interface is fast, the experience is clean, and the tech stack is lightweight and modern.

Built with **React + Vite** and using **Firebase REST API**, the app listens in real-time to message updates and stores everything in the cloud. Styling is handled with **Tailwind CSS**, and **anime.js** is used to breathe life into the interface through smooth transitions and effects.

Over time, more features were added: message liking, dark mode toggle, threaded replies, and a working contact form powered by **EmailJS**. Visitors can now reply to each other’s thoughts, spark mini-discussions, or show support with a single click.

Animations were introduced to create a sense of warmth and modernity, and support for both mobile and desktop users was baked in from day one. No frameworks for backend logic – everything runs via REST calls to Firebase.
